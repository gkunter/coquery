0.10.0 May 23, 2017

This release is a considerable update over earlier versions. These are the
main fields that have seen large changes:

* the interface has been redesigned and streamlined
* a completely new data management system, including a revised way of
  handling functions
* the new visualization designer allows interactive construction of figures
  from the query results

Here is an incomplete list of most of the things that have changed or have
been added:

Interface
* interface resdesign:
  - move column selection to the left as 'Data features'
  - place Query button more prominently in the middle, and rename it
  - replace Aggregation widget by 'Data management' toolbox
* add new dialogs to the 'Help' menu:
  - regular expression tester
  - 'How to cite' dialog
  - module information dialog
* simplify query file widget
* collect hidden columns in a side bar
* there is now a search widget
* change 'Query' button to 'New query'
* make keyboard shortcuts more consistent
* add value substitutions
* improve TextGrid export features
* use Icons8 icon set
* add user data columns
* external links are now persistent when changing the corpus or quitting the
  program
* group and summary functions are now saved on quitting the program
* greatly improve the speed of browsing the results table
* placeholder for empty cells is now configurable

Data management
* the displayed context can now be changed after the query
* add option to restrict contexts to sentence boundaries
* functions are now added to columns in the results table
* add completely revised filter dialog
* add completely revised functions dialog
* introduce data groups, which can split the results into subsets and allow
  functions to act only on the subsets
* introduce Group and Summary functions (the latter replaces the Statistics
  special table)
* add new data functions (Subcorpus size, Frequency ptw, Normalized frequency,
  Number of matches, Number of unique matches, Row number, Type-token ratio)
* add new string functions (CHAIN, UPPER, LOWER), use regex for COUNT
* make regular expression function generally more robust
* add logical functions (ADD, EQUAL, GREATER, GREATEREQUAL, LESS, LESSTHAN,
  NOTEQUAL, AND, OR, XOR)
* add G-test matrix (using corrected probabilities for highlighting)
* add test statistics (log-likelihood test, chi-square test) and effect
  sizes (phi coefficient, odds ratio)
* show both left and right conditional probabilities in Collocations
  aggregation
* add stopword lists for many languages

Visualization
* introduce the Visualization designer
* add new visualizations: heatbar plot, regression plot, scatter plot,
  violin plot, box-whisker plot
* allow vertical plots where sensible

Corpora
* add reference corpus support
* provide functions that use the reference corpus (Keyness LL, Keyness %DIFF,
  as well as frequency functions in the reference corpus)
* big change for corpora that provide audio (currently, only Buckeye is
  supported):
    - add spectrogram and waveform contexts
    - store audio in databases
    - allow audio playback
* improve segment lookup in corpora that contain segments
* allow to build 'corpora' from CSV files
* add support for encoding detection when reading plain text files

Queries
* internal: rewrite SQL code generator, which speeds up multi-word queries
* allow regular expression queries (can be activated in the settings)
* introduction of _NULL special query item (issue #97)
* introduction of _PUNCT special query item as a placeholder for any
  punctuation mark
* add query cache that can speed up repeated queries (experimental)
